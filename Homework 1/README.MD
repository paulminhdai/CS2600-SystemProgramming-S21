## the game Nim

The game is played with one pile of marbles, starting with between 10 and 100 marbles. Two players take turns removing marbles from the pile, and whichever player takes the last marble loses. Each player must take at least one marble and at most half of the marbles. â€‹Note: on the last turn, there will be one marble in the pile: the loser has to take this marble, even though this is more than half of the marbles!

*Extra credit part:*
Rather than having just 1 pile, make your game with 3 piles of marbles (each pile has its own starting count from 10 to 100). When the player (and computer) take a turn, first ask which pile, then ask the number of marbles to take.
